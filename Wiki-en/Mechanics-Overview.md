# 🗺️ Mechanics Overview — What every block, item and feature does

One page that answers "…and what does *that* do?" for the whole plugin. Each section ends with the
page that explains it in depth.

---

## 🔁 The pipeline in six steps

1. **Extract** — the **[Prospector Brush](Archaeology.md)** brushes Overworld, Nether or End geology to
   drop raw minerals (`mvtink_*_raw`), nuggets or storage blocks.
2. **Melt** — the **[Smeltery](Smeltery-and-Casting.md)** melts raw minerals over lava or magma into
   **molten buckets**.
3. **Cast** — a carved **mold** plus a water cauldron turns molten metal into ingots, nuggets, blocks
   or tool **parts**.
4. **Alloy** — the **[Alloy Crucible](Alloy-Mixing.md)** blends two minerals into an alloy, and a
   legendary alloy with another material into a **[prime alloy](Prime-Alloys.md)**.
5. **Assemble** — the **[Forge GUI](Forge-GUI-Guide.md)** bolts parts into modular weapons, tools and
   armor.
6. **Evolve & document** — equipment climbs **7 tiers**, fires its **signature perk and animation**,
   and the **[Alloy Codex](Prime-Alloys.md)** documents every material and recipe.

## ⛏ The Prospector Brush — `mvtink_brush_prospector`

A right-click mining tool that extracts **geology** instead of stone. Brushing a valid surface starts a
timer (`archaeology.brushing-duration-ticks`, 30t default) and then rolls a mineral for that
dimension.

| What it does | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Valid targets** | Overworld: Stone / Cobblestone · Nether: Netherrack / Blackstone · End: End Stone |
| **Success roll** | `archaeology.success-chance` per dimension (0.45 / 0.40 / 0.35) |
| **What drops** | A raw mineral, or a nugget (`nugget-chance`), or — with the **prospector** upgrade — a whole storage **block** (`block-chance`) |
| **Which mineral** | Weighted by rarity, tuned with `rarity-weights` (shipped: common 50, uncommon 30, rare 14, epic 5, legendary 1; `0` takes a rarity off the table). The prospector brush **doubles** the weight of rare, epic and legendary minerals |
| **Block after** | `archaeology.block-behavior`: `DEGRADE` (stone → cobblestone → gravel → air), `COOLDOWN`, or `NONE` |
| **Anti-macro** | Every block has a `block-cooldown-seconds` (15s) per-block timer |
| **Cost** | `brush-durability-cost` durability per extraction; `access.archaeology` decides who may brush at all (**public** by default) |

Every mineral it can drop, with its traits, is listed in the **[Material Reference](Material-Reference.md)**.

## 🔥 The Smeltery — `mvtink_smeltery`

A placeable crucible that **melts** minerals. Stand over a heat source and feed it raw ore, ingots,
nuggets or blocks; it returns **molten buckets** you can pour later.

| What it does | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Heat** | Lava is the fastest source; a magma block melts `smeltery.magma-duration-multiplier` (1.30 = 30%) slower |
| **Cost** | Each completed melt has `smeltery.lava-consume-chance` (10%) to consume the lava beneath |
| **Speed** | Each mineral has its own `meltingDurationTicks` (50t for Talc up to 240t for endgame minerals) |
| **Diagnostics** | The smeltery GUI reports its current heat, progress and contents |

## ⚗ Casting & molds — the 13 `CastType` molds

Molds turn molten metal into a usable item. Carve them in the Forge GUI and cool them in a water
cauldron; the same mold is **reusable**.

| Mold | Turns molten metal into |
|---|---|
| Ingot / Nugget / Block cast | Standard ingots, **9 nuggets**, storage blocks |
| Head / Handle / Pommel cast | Weapon and tool **heads**, **handles (rods)** and **pommels (bindings)** |
| Bow Limbs / Bowstring mold | Bow **limbs** and **bowstrings** |
| Shield Faceplate / Shield Boss cast | Shield **plates** and **bosses** |
| Armor Plate / Lining / Trim cast | Armor **plates**, **linings** and **trims** |

Each part is a real item (`mvtink_*_head`, `_rod`, `_binding`, …) that the Forge later assembles.

---

## 🏗️ The Multiverse Forge multiblock

A **243-block** structure centred on an **anvil**, with lava corner columns, chiseled tuff bricks and
deepslate tiles (see [Forge Structure](Forge-Structure.md)). Right-click the central anvil to validate
it, activate it and open the GUI. `/mvtink forge build` constructs it instantly and
`/mvtink forge check` reports how many blocks match.

---

## 🧰 The Forge GUI — six tabs

| Tab | What it does |
|---|---|
| **1. Guides** | Interactive books: structure, multi-material forging, crucible, tiers and perks — plus the **book button** that opens the Alloy Codex |
| **2. Molds & Parts** | Carve molds from clay bricks and cast **up to 3 materials per part**; the concentration (100% / 50-50 / 33-33-33) decides how strongly each material's traits express |
| **3. Alloy Crucible** | Two input slots and one **Melt & Blend** button; yields **2 ingots** of the alloy |
| **4. Weapon Assembly** | Cycles the 7 weapon types and assembles the forged parts |
| **5. Tool Assembly** | Cycles the 5 tool types and assembles them |
| **6. Armor Assembly** | Cycles the 4 armor pieces and assembles them |

---

## 🛠️ Modular equipment

A forged item keeps its own **durability counter**, its **tier** and its **essence blend**. Vanilla
wear is always disabled (`equipment.modular-attack-damage` chooses whether the damage also comes from
the minerals) so the plugin and Minecraft never spend durability on the same swing.

### Weapons (7)

| Weapon | Parts | Signature perk | Exclusive animation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Broadsword** | head + handle + pommel | **Sweeping Cleave** | Sweeping Arc |
| **Longbow** | limbs + bowstring | **Infused Volley** | Volley Trail |
| **Heavy Crossbow** | head + handle + pommel | **Piercing Velocity** | Piercing Lance |
| **Elder Trident** | head + handle + pommel | **Hydraulic Surge** | Surge Column |
| **Kinetic Spear** | head + handle + pommel | **Jousting Reach** | Thrust Line |
| **War Mace** | head + handle + pommel | **Seismic Smash** | Shock Ring |
| **Tower Shield** | plate + boss | **Retaliation Barrier** | Parapet Arc |

### Tools (5 + the broadsword)

| Tool | Signature perk | Exclusive animation |
|---|---|---|
| **Pickaxe** | **Vein Resonance** — bonus ores from resonating seams + temporary Haste | Vein Strike |
| **Battleaxe** | **Lumber Cleave** — fells whole trunks, shatters shields | Lumber Splash |
| **Excavator** | **Seismic Tremor** — sneak-digging clears a 3×3 area | Ground Wave |
| **Scythe** | **Harvest Scythe** — reaps a 3×3 field and replants seeds | Harvest Swirl |
| **Fishing Rod** | **Abyssal Dredge** — deep water can hook rare raw minerals | Dredge Drip |

### Armor (4)

| Piece | Signature perk | Exclusive animation |
|---|---|---|
| **Helmet** | **Cranium Ward** — wards headshot impact, filters hazards | Cranium Halo |
| **Chestplate** | **Kinetic Dampener** — absorbs heavy impacts | Kinetic Dome |
| **Leggings** | **Stride Momentum** — mitigates sprint drain | Stride Coil |
| **Boots** | **Feathered Grounding** — negates fall damage, keeps traction | Grounding Puff |

Each share is rolled with the piece rather than fixed: 30% / 25% / 50% at the bare slot, growing with the piece's rolled Defense and Toughness up to 65% / 60% / 75%.

### The 10 parts

`HEAD` (damage, speed, primary strike) · `ROD` (durability multiplier) · `BINDING` (durability + utility)
· `BOW_LIMBS` (draw speed, velocity) · `BOWSTRING` (firing energy) · `SHIELD_PLATE` (frontal block)
· `SHIELD_BOSS` (parry stability) · `ARMOR_PLATE` (defense) · `ARMOR_LINING` (toughness) · `ARMOR_TRIM`
(knockback resistance). Legacy ids `_processed` (ingot), `_handle` (rod) and `_pommel` (binding) still
resolve.

### The 7 tiers

Equipment levels **by being used**: weapons gain XP on kills, tools on blocks broken, armor on damage
absorbed.

| Tier | Kills | Blocks | Damage absorbed | Damage multiplier | Durability multiplier |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **Wood** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0 | 1.00x |
| **Stone** | 15 | 50 | 150 | 0.8 | 1.15x |
| **Copper** | 40 | 150 | 350 | 1.5 | 1.30x |
| **Iron** | 80 | 350 | 650 | 2.5 | 1.50x |
| **Gold** | 150 | 750 | 900 | 3.5 | 1.80x |
| **Diamond** | 300 | 1,500 | 1,500 | 5.0 | 2.20x |
| **Netherite ★ MAX** | 600 | 3,000 | 2,500 | 7.0 | 2.80x |

### Essences and animations

Every material teaches up to **3 deterministic essences** (Infernal, Void, Primal, Terrain, Tempered,
Radiant, Resonant, Volatile, Swift, Brutal, Bulwark, Ascendant) that behave differently on weapons,
tools and armor — see [Trait Affinities](Trait-Affinities.md). **Every** mineral (see
[Perk Names](Perk-Names.md)) names the perk, the **head** owns its identity essence, the
**handle/pommel** set its potency, and an **80% essence focus** unlocks that essence'
**[ultimate](Essence-Ultimates.md)**.

Each of the **16 equipment types** owns an exclusive particle choreography and sound, played when its
perk actually fires and tinted with the dominant mineral's colour. Tune them with the
`animations` keys (`enabled`, `particle-scale`, `sounds`, `cooldown-millis`).

## 🧪 The three alloy tiers

| Tier | Inputs | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Legendary** | Two specific minerals (16 curated recipes) | The curated alloy with its own trait |
| **Composite** | Any two blendable minerals | `<A>-<B> Alloy` with the inherited essences |
| **Prime** | A legendary alloy + (another alloy, a mineral or a catalyst) | `<A> <B> Prime`, with the catalyst's ultimate and armor state |

**Catalysts** are real vanilla items (Nether Star, Blue Ice, Echo Shard…) that are never blended alone:
they shape the endgame build. The complete list of pairs and traits lives in the
**[Alloy Recipe Index](Alloy-Recipe-Index.md)**.

---

## 📖 The Alloy Codex

A 54-slot, paginated menu open to **every player** with `/mvtink codex`, also reachable from the book
button in the Crucible tab. Its **seven sections**: Legendary Recipes · Prime Catalysts · Forged
Composites · Prime Alloys · Combination Explorer · Alloy Space Summary · **Mineral Catalog**.

The catalog has two **scopes** (**Scope** button) — the curated material list and the flat list of
**every registered item id** (2,656 today) — a **Kind** filter, and a drill-down that lists every id a
material owns, each entry spelling out the `/mvtink give <player> <id>` line.

Finding one mineral among the 139 takes two clicks. The three filter buttons — **Dimension**,
**Rarity** and **Essence** — swap the grid for a picker instead of cycling, because twelve essences
behind repeated clicks would be worse than no filter at all. Every option announces how many
materials it would leave, so an empty combination is obvious before clicking it. The filters
**stack**: dimension, then rarity within it, then the essences that survive both, and the info button
spells the active combination out. Choosing **Any** clears that one filter. In the every-item scope
the same filters narrow the ids through the material each one belongs to — and, since the crucible,
the brush and the casts belong to no material at all, any active filter hides them.

## 💻 Commands & permissions

| Command | Who | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/mvtink` | everyone | Public help (only `codex`). With `multiversetinker.admin` or any of its per-subcommand nodes: the help for the subcommands that player may run |
| `/mvtink codex [player]` | codex users; another player needs admin | Opens the Alloy Codex |
| `/mvtink craft <weapon\|tool\|armor> <type> <m1> <m2> [m3] [tier]` | admin | Forges equipment instantly; each part takes one material or up to three joined with `+` |
| `/mvtink give <player> <id> [amount]` | admin | Gives any registered item, forging and registering the alloy when the id names a crucible pair nobody has smelted yet (a prime over an unsmelted composite forges both) |
| `/mvtink forge <build\|check\|gui> [rotation]` | admin | Builds / validates / opens the Forge |
| `/mvtink verify` | admin | Diagnoses the item registry |
| `/mvtink reload` | admin | Reloads config, items and loot |

`/mvtink codex` is the only command a player is meant to have; every other subcommand is administrator work and
asks for a node first, which **no config can open** — the umbrella `multiversetinker.admin` grants all five, while
`multiversetinker.admin.craft`, `.give`, `.forge`, `.verify` and `.reload` grant a single subcommand each, so a
server can hand out just one slice. Operators hold the umbrella (and every slice) by default and a permissions
plugin can grant either to a player.

Permissions: `multiversetinker.admin` and its per-subcommand nodes
(`multiversetinker.admin.craft`, `.give`, `.forge`, `.verify`, `.reload`) (op) · `multiversetinker.forge` (everyone) ·
`multiversetinker.codex` (everyone) · `multiversetinker.archaeology` (everyone) — and the `access` block of
`config.yml` opens or closes the codex, the forge and archaeology as **public**, **op** or **permission**, so a
server decides without installing a permissions plugin. See **[Configuration](Configuration.md#-who-may-use-what-access)**.

Tab completion offers **every registered item id** in one list and filters it as you type, and the
`mvtink_` prefix is optional everywhere — typing `tin` finds `mvtink_tin`, `mvtink_tin_ingot` and the
rest. In `/mvtink craft` the material slots accept those item ids too, so an id copied out of the
codex can be pasted straight in. A slot can also **blend up to three materials** joined with `+`
(`gold+ruby+cobalt` → 33/33/34, `gold+ruby` → 50/50), the same mixes the Forge's part table casts,
and tab completion keeps what was already typed before the `+`. A crucible **pair id**
(`alloy_tin_zinc`, `prime_alloy_tin_zinc_bronze`) is forged and registered on the spot, so every
alloy and every mixed part the Forge can make is reachable without it.

## 💾 What persists

Everything players discover is written to `plugins/MultiverseTinker/`: composite and prime alloys to
`dynamic-alloys.yml`, so an ingot forged last week still works as a forging component after a restart.
