# 🧪 Alloy Mixing & Metallurgy Guide

The **Multiverse Forge** features a dedicated **Alloy Crucible** (Section 3 of the Forge GUI) capable of superheating and fusing two distinct metallurgical or crystalline minerals into powerful, specialized alloys.

> ♻ **Universal blending**: *any* two distinct minerals obtained with the **Prospector Brush** (Overworld, Nether or End geology) or refined from **vanilla Minecraft ores** can be blended — not just the 16 legendary recipes. Every pair synthesizes its own alloy with its own trait, and that trait adapts to **weapons, tools and armor** (see [Trait Affinities](Trait-Affinities.md)). Finished alloys cannot be re-blended, which keeps the crucible from looping infinitely. That leaves **110 blendable minerals** and **5,995 blendable pairs**, of which 14 resolve to a legendary recipe; vanilla netherite is the sole special case (it is already classified as an alloy, so it only blends inside its two curated recipes: **Cinder Steel** and **Cosmic Netherite**), which brings the crucible to **5,997 distinct mineral alloys** in total.

> 🌌 **Prime tier**: the crucible carries a third category. A **legendary alloy** can be fused again — with another legendary alloy, a composite alloy, any mineral, or one of the **12 vanilla catalysts** (Nether Star, Blue Ice, Echo Shard…) — producing a **prime alloy** with boosted stats and its own ultimate and armor state. See **[Prime Alloys](Prime-Alloys.md)**; with every composite discovered the crucible reaches **103,781** distinct alloys. Everything you forge is saved to `dynamic-alloys.yml` and restored on the next startup.

> 📚 **Need the full list?** Every blendable pair — all **5,995** of them — with the alloy it forges and the essences it inherits lives in the **[Alloy Recipe Index](Alloy-Recipe-Index.md)**. Per-material sources, stats and traits are in the **[Material Reference](Material-Reference.md)**.

## ⚒ How Alloy Mixing Works

1. **Access the Crucible**:
   - Open an active **Multiverse Forge Anvil**.
   - Click on the **[ 3. Alloy Crucible ]** tab in the top navigation bar.
2. **Load Components**:
   - Place **Material 1** in **Slot 20** (Ingot, Gem, Mineral, or Molten Liquid Bucket).
   - Place **Material 2** in **Slot 24** (Ingot, Gem, Mineral, or Molten Liquid Bucket).
3. **Melt & Blend**:
   - Click the **🔥 Melt & Blend Alloy** button in **Slot 31**.
   - If the recipe is valid, the thermal resonance fuses the components and yields **2x Finished Alloy Ingots** in **Slot 33**.
   - If molten buckets were used, empty buckets are returned to your inventory.
4. **Usage in Forging**:
   - The resulting alloy ingots can be used directly as materials in **Section 2 (Molds & Parts)** to forge modular heads, handles, pommels, bow limbs, bowstrings, and shield components.

## 📜 Complete Alloy Recipes Table

The 16 recipes below are **predefined**: they always take priority and keep their curated signature
ability. Every other legal pair of brush/vanilla minerals produces a **dynamic composite alloy**
named `<Mineral A>-<Mineral B> Alloy`, inheriting the affinities of both parents.

## 💡 Metallurgy Tips

- **Dual Ingot Yield**: Every successful alloy smelt yields **2 ingots**, preserving exact material conservation.
- **Cross-Dimensional Blends**: Combining Overworld precious metals with Nether or End minerals unlocks endgame capabilities such as **Cosmic Netherite** and **Void Damascus**.
- **Alloy Part Forging**: Alloy ingots can also be mixed with other minerals in Section 2 (Multi-Material Casting) for combined hybrid synergies!
- **Blendable inputs only**: The crucible rejects non-mineral tinker items (casts, tool parts, smeltery, brush) and already-finished alloys. Distinct minerals only — a mineral cannot be paired with itself.
- **Netherite exception**: vanilla `mvtink_netherite` is already classified as an alloy, so it cannot be freely blended with arbitrary minerals. It still works inside its two curated recipes, so all **16 legendary alloys are craftable**; every other netherite pairing is rejected.
- **Adaptive effects**: An alloy forged into a **weapon** triggers offensive procs, into a **tool** triggers mining procs, and into **armor** triggers defensive procs. See [Trait Affinities](Trait-Affinities.md).
- **Essence inheritance**: an alloy carries the essences of **both** parent minerals, so a Manyullyn weapon reads as **Infernal** (Nether parents) and a Void Damascus one as **Void** instead of every alloy sharing one generic metal essence.
- **The id a pair would produce is real**: the Combination Explorer previews the id of every pair the crucible accepts, and `/mvtink give <player> <id>` accepts it even when nobody has smelted that pair yet — the command forges and registers the alloy exactly like the crucible would, and says so in chat. A pair the crucible refuses is still refused, so the command can never mint an alloy the crucible would not. A prime over a composite nobody has smelted yet works in one go: the composite is forged first, then the prime. `/mvtink craft` accepts the same pair ids in its material slots.
- **Your discoveries persist**: every composite alloy you forge is written to `plugins/MultiverseTinker/dynamic-alloys.yml` and restored on the next startup, so ingots you crafted days ago keep working as forging components. The crucible codex also reports how many of the **8,085 base combinations** you have discovered (up to **103,781** once every composite is known).
- **Prime fusion**: pair a legendary alloy with another alloy, a mineral or a vanilla catalyst item to forge a **prime alloy** — the endgame tier with freezing ultimates, meteor storms and the 9 new armor states. Full rules in [Prime Alloys](Prime-Alloys.md).
